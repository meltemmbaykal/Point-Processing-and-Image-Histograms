# Point-Processing-and-Image-Histograms

Task 1 â€“ Point Processing and Image Histograms

For this task, you are given four input images.
For each input image, apply the following point processing transformations: 
a) Adding 128 to each pixel, subtracting 128 from each pixel, 
b) multiplying each pixel value by 2, 
c) dividing each pixel value by 2, 
d) taking the negative of the image. 
For each transformation, generate a figure .

 There are 6 fields in the figure: 

1) Original image,
 2) Transformation function, 
3) Modified image,
4) Histogram of the original image, 
5) Image statistics of both original and modified images, 
6) Histogram of the modified image.
